# Binary Calculator

This project demonstrates the ability to work with binary numbers in Java, including performing basic arithmetic operations on them. The program includes a Binary class with a constructor that stores a binary number as a String and truncates any leading zeros. It also includes methods such as `getValue()` to return the binary number as a string and `add()` to perform a bitwise add on two Binary objects and return a new Binary object representing the result.

The project also includes a JUnit test class, `BinaryTest.java`, that tests the functionality of the Binary class and its methods.
